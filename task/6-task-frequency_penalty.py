# TODO:
#  Try `frequency_penalty` parameter.
#  Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's
#  likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim. Higher values == less repetitive text.
#       Range: -2.0 to 2.0
#       Default: 0.0

# Pay attention that when we set for `gpt-4o` frequency_penalty as -2.0 - the request is running too long,
# and in the result we can get something strange (such as repetitive words in the end).
